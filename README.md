# Motion-of-an-electron-in-a-mag-elec-field

Decription:

This program utilizes Visual python to simulate a customized electric field and pre defined magnetic field that affect the path movement of an electron. The electric field direction is shown through 3-D arrows in yellow, and the magnetic field in green 3-D arrows. The elctron itself is a sphere in red that has it's path tracked via a line. By utilizing the force equations for the elctric and magnetic fields that affect acceleration, velocity and overall position of the elctron the program is able simulate the expected path as given by the coordinates of the user defined electric field. 

    For a simple easy to view example for the E-field coordinates enter as follows:
      x-coor: -0.1
      y-coor: 0.01
      z-coor: 0.01
